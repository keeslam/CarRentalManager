# Car Rental Management System

## Overview
This is a comprehensive car rental management system offering full management of vehicles, customers, reservations, expenses, and documents. It features a dashboard for key metrics, calendar views for reservations, and extensive reporting. The system includes a damage check template editor, a simplified one-button backup system, auto-logout security, advanced reporting with a custom report builder, maintenance cost analysis, and a complete multi-driver management system. The project aims to provide a robust and user-friendly platform for efficient car rental operations.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query)
- **Routing**: Wouter
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui (built on Radix UI)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Build Tool**: Vite

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Authentication**: Passport.js (local strategy, session-based)
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM
- **File Handling**: Multer (local storage)
- **PDF Generation**: pdf-lib
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL session store with connect-pg-simple

### Database Design
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon serverless)
- **Schema Management**: Safe migration system using `startup-migration.js`
- **Migration Safety**: 
  - **NEVER use `npm run db:push` in production** - it drops and recreates tables, causing complete data loss
  - Use `startup-migration.js` for safe schema changes - it runs automatically on deployment via `nixpacks.toml`
  - Safe migrations use `ALTER TABLE` to add columns without data loss
  - All deployments backfill data intelligently and add constraints safely
  - Deployment fails on any integrity issues (preventing unsafe states)
- **Core Tables**: users, vehicles, customers, reservations, expenses, documents, pdf_templates, custom_notifications, damage_check_templates, saved_reports, whatsapp_messages, drivers, settings
- **Relationships**: Foreign keys link reservations to vehicles/customers, expenses to vehicles, documents to vehicles. Multiple drivers per customer.

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Authentication**: Username/password with bcrypt hashing
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL store
- **Role-Based Access**: Admin, Manager, User, Cleaner, Viewer, Accountant, Maintenance roles with granular permissions.
- **Protection**: Route-level authentication middleware, Rate Limiting, CSRF Protection, Account Lockout, Session Management.
- **Security Features**: Audit Logging, Password History, Security Headers (Helmet.js), Input Sanitization (DOMPurify).

### File Management
- **Upload Handling**: Local file system storage in `uploads` directory for documents, driver licenses, and vehicle diagrams.
- **Document Types**: Contracts, maintenance records, photos, receipts.
- **Vehicle Diagram Storage**: Filesystem storage in `uploads/vehicle-diagrams/` with a robust matching algorithm.
- **Template Background Storage**: Environment-aware storage (Object Storage on Replit, local filesystem elsewhere).

### Data Validation
- **Schema Validation**: Zod schemas (shared between frontend/backend).
- **Form Validation**: Client-side with server-side verification.
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage.

### Key Features and Implementations
- **Damage Check Template Editor**: Customizable inspection templates (Dutch format) with vehicle diagram support, multi-column layouts, and JSON storage for inspection points.
- **Damage Check PDF Generation**: Automated PDF generation service from templates, integrating reservation and customer data, with multi-page support and intelligent template matching.
- **Reservation Damage Check Integration**: Direct damage check generation from reservation workflow, saving versioned documents linked to reservations and vehicles.
- **PDF Template Editor with Driver Data Support**: Template editor includes driver information fields for dynamic population in PDFs.
- **Backup System**: One-click database (SQL) and application code (tar.gz) download with recovery instructions.
- **Auto-Logout**: Inactivity detection logs users out after 2 minutes.
- **Custom Report Builder**: Drag-and-drop interface for creating custom reports.
- **WhatsApp Messaging Dashboard**: Foundation for customer conversations and sending capabilities.
- **Vehicle Delivery/Pickup Service**: Delivery options in reservations with fee calculation and tracking.
- **Maintenance Cost Analysis**: Dashboard with cost breakdown, charts, and trend analysis.
- **Maintenance History Tracking**: Comprehensive history section in vehicle details.
- **Multi-Driver Management**: Separate drivers table, association with customers, reservation assignment, and license upload.
- **Document Management**: Reservation-specific document uploads.
- **Fuel Management**: Pickup/return fuel levels, cost tracking, and fuel card fields.
- **Corporate Customer Features**: Business/individual types, billing contacts, corporate discounts.
- **Email Templates**: Multi-language support for customer communications and smart template selection based on document types.
- **Completed Rentals Management**: Calendar filtering to show only active rentals, with a separate dialog for viewing and managing completed rentals (revert/delete functionality).
- **English-Only Interface**: Internal staff interface is English-only.
- **Four-Tier Vehicle Availability System**: Comprehensive status tracking with four states: `available` (ready for rental), `needs_fixing` (in workshop/repairs), `not_for_rental` (owned but not rented), and `rented` (currently rented). Status is displayed throughout the system with color-coded badges (green for available, yellow for needs fixing, gray for not for rental, blue for rented). This allows clear tracking of vehicle ownership, operational status, and rental availability.
- **Automatic BV→Opnaam Registration Conversion**: When creating or editing a reservation with a BV-registered vehicle, the system automatically converts it to Opnaam (personal registration). This ensures legal compliance, as BV vehicles cannot be driven (no insurance/road tax). Conversion happens on both frontend and backend with user notification.
- **Contract Number Management**: Contract numbers are assigned at pickup time through the status-change dialog. When transitioning a reservation from "booked" to "picked_up", the contract number field is required and validated. Contract numbers are preserved when editing already-picked-up reservations, preventing data loss. Contract numbers are displayed in reservation forms, view dialogs, and integrated into PDF generation as {{contractNumber}} variable. The system includes database-level constraints to ensure data integrity. The `contract_number` column is **nullable** to allow reservation creation without contract numbers (assigned later during pickup). When a reservation is soft-deleted, its contract number is cleared (set to NULL) to free it up for reuse.
- **Safe Deployment System**: Production deployments run `startup-migration.js` automatically (configured in `nixpacks.toml`) to safely add new columns and backfill data without data loss. The system prevents unsafe deployments by failing if duplicates are detected or constraints cannot be added.
